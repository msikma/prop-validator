# prop-validator

A simplified rewrite of the React PropTypes library, designed for use outside of React on arbitrary Javascript data.

This can be used as a quick and simple data validation toolâ€”for example, to validate config files, or data passed by a user into a function.

## Usage

TODO

### Differences with the original PropTypes library

The API is almost the same as the original PropTypes library, but there are a few small changes. Since this is not designed for React or DOM objects, the following types are not supported: `node`, `element`, `elementType`.
